### There are many platforms that do the same but Writer's Cafe comes with some special features: 

- Your writtern work can be public or private. If it's public anyone can read it. If it's private only you can read it.
- You can find authors that live near you, (and connect with them) if they have chosen to share their location.
- It is integrated with a voice recognition software that converts your speech to text. Instead of typing the content, you can jsut dictate it.
- Filter stories by their genre and work type.
- Leave comments and ratings
- A compelling UI and a great UX :)
